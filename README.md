## Description

I took starter code with a fully functioning Google Books API search engine built with a RESTful API, and refactored for deployment to Heroku and Atlas. The app was built using the MERN stack with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API. It's already set up to allow users to save book searches to the back end.
